/*
* NOTE: We should avoid using this file. It's mostly here as a "just-in-case" but for individual component styles we want to use styled-components.
* 
* For example, if we have a div and we want it's width to 20px, instead of doing this in app.css:
*   .wideDiv {
*      width: 20px;
*   }
* 
* We should do this in the .tsx file:
*   const WideDiv = styled.div`
*     width: 20px;
*   `;
